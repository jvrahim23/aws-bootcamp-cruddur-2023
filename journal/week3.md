# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication


##### This week was again challenging for me. I did make sure to test the reset code for the application. 
##### I also, worked on creating multiple AWS Cognito Users. Then I check to see
##### if I could authenticate them. I also, signed up and logged in with the users. All worked well. 
##### As I am a beginner to cloud. I am not able to expand on more advance challenges. But,
######  I am reading up on AWS Cognito and the JWT Token to understand how it works. I have completed the tasks for this week.
