# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

##### This week was again challenging for me. I took some time to read up on Observability. 
##### I am still a little confused about the topic. I think it may be a great tool to use to understand the issues with endpoints?
##### For example, can we use it to see why an api and running slow? I have to do more deep diving. 
##### I am still struggling with Rollbar. I keep recieving the below message. No access_token provided. Please configure by calling rollbar.init() with your access token.
###### I have tried everything. For example, I have tried re-adding the env variable with the access keys. I have to perform another deep dive 
regarding this topic too. 
##### Lastly, I completed all the to-dos this week, quizzes and watched all the videos.
