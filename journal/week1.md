# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

##### This week was challenging for me. I used Docker in 2022, but I do not use it regularly. I will continue to research and practice in Docker and in using its commands.
##### I learned how to install Docker on my local machine, and I got the same containers running outside of Gitpod / Codespaces.
##### I installed venv in VSCode. venv allowed me to create a virtual environment with the dependencies needed for a limited time. Venv and all my files to a new branch here: jvrahim23/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023 at week1 (github.com).
##### I still need to add all the code from main > week 1(notifications code) to my week1 repo. But I was able to see the app running at localhost:3000.
##### Also, I created a Docker Hub account and pushed my frontend and backend images to it. Images here: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jvrahim23/aws-free-cloud-bootcamp/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated
##### While in VScode, I used Synk command docker scan to search my images for vulnerabilities. My frontend app has 389 vulnerabilities. Due to these vulnerabilities, I researched how to correct or fix the issues. The fix is still a work in process for me.
##### Lastly, I completed all the to-dos this week and watched all the videos.
